      "full": "Cropsey is one of New York's most chilling urban legends—a boogeyman figure who allegedly haunted the abandoned buildings and woods of Staten Island, kidnapping and murdering children. For decades, Cropsey existed purely as campfire horror story fodder, a cautionary tale parents told to keep children from wandering into dangerous places. But in the 1970s and 1980s, the legend took a dark turn when a series of real child disappearances on Staten Island led authorities to Andre Rand, a former custodian at the notorious Willowbrook State School for the mentally disabled. The convergence of urban legend and actual crime created a unique and disturbing case study in how folklore can both predict and shape real-world events. The Cropsey legend influenced how investigators, media, and the public understood the disappearances, while the real crimes reinforced and amplified the legend itself. This phenomenon, known as \\\"ostension\\\" in folklore studies, demonstrates the complex relationship between myth and reality."
